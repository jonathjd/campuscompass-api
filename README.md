  - `crud/`: Contains CRUD operations.
  - `db/`: Database configurations and models.
  - `schemas/`: Pydantic schemas for data validation and serialization.
  - `main.py`: Entry point for the FastAPI application.
- `docker-compose.yml` and `dockerfile`: Docker configurations for containerization.
- `etl/`: ETL scripts for data extraction and loading.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python package dependencies.
- `tests/`: Test cases for the API.
